Note: Static vs. nonstatic images?

Note: login integration system
Note: Diagnostics (sorta like push notifications, but simpler for only thumbs up, down, or middle; + who is on the active
screen + records/storage of this data for later on + seeing which slide students are on + monitoring screens (?) )
Note: re-editable text boxes
Note: Toggle for student view, teacher view etc. 
Note: Voice recording
Note: Student independent page up/down
Note: Teacher non-transfer option 

Note: lock code so that random users cannot view all of it through the web browser (how?)
Note: Fix Images from drive so it doesn't always start at 0,0

Unreplicated glitches: 
Socket.io would randomly add users (teacher) back into the same room but without ability to draw
Google images would load but wouldn't save to teacher's canvas if teacher undo/redo/update; however would appear on other tablets/whiteboard client
Random copy issue with dotted line saving and replicating over
