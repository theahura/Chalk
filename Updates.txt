//For next update
Fix glitches + memory leaks
Figure out crashing issue**************
- memory based
- short term crashing caused by large image/data loads
- Limit images based on filesize, and set each page with its own undo/redo list instead of with images and a global undo/redo list

Unreplicated glitches: 
Socket.io would randomly add users (teacher) back into the same room but without ability to draw
Random copy issue with dotted line saving and replicating over
Update failed to work, possibly sent whiteboard into negative pages
