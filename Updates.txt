Added Update feature to server
	Made UpdateToClient/ToServer events on server side
	Added backuplists object to keep track of room backup lists
	Changed the location of the update button and moved the function to custom socket event

Made it so that the code recognizes and separates saving new pages in a different location/folder

BugFix: Highlight mode copy/pan on student side wasn't working (came out transparent)

Moved Update client event to ScriptsCommon instead of ScriptsCommonFeatures (separating function from UI)

Fixed size of input textbox (HTML/CSS)

Added -webkit-select-none to prevent text selection
