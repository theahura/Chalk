Note: login integration system
Note: Diagnostics (sorta like push notifications, but simpler for only thumbs up, down, or middle; + who is on the active
screen + records/storage of this data for later on + seeing which slide students are on + monitoring screens (?) )
Note: re-editable text boxes
Note: Toggle for student view, teacher view etc. 
Note: Voice recording
Note: Student independent page up/down

Glitch: bottom pull up menu kills app function on second+ page
Glitch: Pageup/down memory leak + image storage/Google Picker memory leak with image previews
